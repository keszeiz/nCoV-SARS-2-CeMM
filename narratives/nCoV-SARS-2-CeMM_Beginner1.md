abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.


The aim is to sequence 1,000 viral genomes derived of samples taken from Austrian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The knowledge we gain will help us learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen. The results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the route of the pathogen from country to country."

We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists at CeMM in Vienna, Austria. CeMM is a Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.


We at CeMM are dedicated to better understand diseases such as cancer, immune disorders or COVID-19.


When there are so many [uncertainties]( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/ "Why the Coronavirus Is So Confusing") around COVID-19, our mission is to better understand the evolution and the spread of this disease.

# [What are mutations?](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov)

* The virion of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a tiny oily bubble that contains the genome of the virus â€“ a long code containing information on how to make new viruses.
This is what viruses are good at: they reprogram our cells to make millions of copies of themselves.
* The code is stored in the form of RNA, and the sequence of four nucleotides represented by the letters _a_, _c_, _g_ and _u_ determine what kind of proteins will the host cell produce when it translates this almost 30,000 "letters" long code.
* New copies of the virus are just like the original: the code packed in the oily bubble. However, when the cell makes a copy of this long code, it will inevitably make "typos". These "typos" are called **mutations**, and most of them do not change the proteins of the virus. Instead, they serve as "signatures" for us to follow how does the virus spread.

The virion consists of a long RNA that codes all the information required for it's own manufacturing, hidden inside of an oily membrane. This membrane is rich in protein protrusions, such as the characteristic "spikes", here shown in yellow, from which coronaviruses take their name.
