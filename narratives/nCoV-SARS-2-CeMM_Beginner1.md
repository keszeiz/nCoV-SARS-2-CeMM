abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.


The aim is to sequence 1,000 viral genomes derived of samples taken from Austrian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The knowledge we gain will help us learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen. The results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the route of the pathogen from country to country."

We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists at CeMM in Vienna, Austria. CeMM is a Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.


We at CeMM are dedicated to better understand diseases such as cancer, immune disorders or COVID-19.


When there are so many [uncertainties]( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/ "Why the Coronavirus Is So Confusing") around COVID-19, our mission is to better understand the evolution and the spread of this disease.
