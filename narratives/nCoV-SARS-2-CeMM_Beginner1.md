abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.
The aim is to sequence 1,000 viral genomes derived of samples taken from Austrian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The knowledge we gain will help us learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen. The results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the route of the pathogen from country to country."

* We are a group of scientists at CeMM in Vienna, Austria.
CeMM is a Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.
We at CeMM are dedicated to better understand diseases such as cancer, immune disorders or COVID-19.
* When there are so many [uncertainties]( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/ "Why the Coronavirus Is So Confusing") around COVID-19, our mission is to better understand the evolution and the spread of this disease.

# [What does sequencing the viral genome mean and why is it useful?](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov)
* A coronavirus is a tiny oily bubble that contains the genome of the virus – a long code containing information on how to make new viruses.
* This is what viruses are good at: they reprogram our cells to make millions of copies of them.
* The code is stored in the form of RNA, and the sequence of four “letters”: _a_, _c_, _g_ and _u_ determine what kind of proteins will the host cell produce when it translates this almost 30,000 “letters” long code.

* New copies of the virus are just like the original: the code packed in the oily bubble. However, when the cell makes a copy of this long code, it will inevitably make typos. These typos are called __mutations__, and most of them do not change the proteins of the virus.
* Instead, they serve as “signatures” for us to follow how does the virus spread.
* If a mutated genome is packed into the oily membrane and infects a new host, this host will make copies of the mutated genome. It might again make some mistakes introducing other mutations, that could again further spread in the population.
* Sequencing means uncovering the sequence of the letters.
* A group of people who acquired the virus from the same source will have similar mutational signature. By sequencing the viral genome derived from the samples of infected people, we can or infer the origin of infections.
