abstract: "
SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing COVID-19. Under the project <a href='https://cemm.at/research/sars-cov-2-at/about/' target='_ blank'>Mutational Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria</a>, CeMM, in collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna have so far sequenced 318 viral genomes isolated from COVID-10 patients in Austria. The genomic data has been integrated into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

This week, we will concentrate on how often mutations appear in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and show a mutation that likely emerged in Austria."

# [About the virus, mutations and phylogenetic trees](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/OnlyAustrianv19?c=clade_membership&l=clock)

A virus particle consists of a long RNA genome that codes all the information required for its own manufacturing, hidden inside of an oily membrane. When copying this almost 30'000 "letters" long code, typos - mutations - are inevitably introduced.

# [Mutations can help us draw a phylogenetic tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav20?branchLabel=clade&c=gt-nuc_23731&d=tree&f_region=Africa&label=clade:20B&m=div&p=full)

* Mutations can occur every time the 30'000-nucleotides-long RNA genome is copied. As the mutated genome can be further spread in the population, mutations will accumulate over time during a pandemic.

* Similarly to how our DNA genome and that of our parents and siblings are alike, virus genomes that largely contain the same mutations are more closely related than those containing many distinct ones.

* The example shows viral genomes isolated in Africa. Remember, whenever we see a new branch (here seen in yellow) emerging from a vertical line (here seen in blue), it means a mutation have occurred. Hoover your mouse over the branch to see which nucleotide of the code has mutated.

* We see that the genomes UG008 and UG014 from Uganda are closer relatives to each other than to 1565_S13 from Ghana. We can now speculate that the mutation that gave rise to the branch where UG008 and UG014 belongs have emerged in Uganda.

* However, it is also possible that this mutation has emerged in another country, where it was never sequenced, but introduced to Uganda multiple times.


# [Mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other viruses](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav20?d=tree&l=clock&p=full)

* If we look at the sequences of many viral genomes and see how mutations accumulate over time, we can estimate how quickly they occur.

* Based on the 8000 genomes present in this dataset, Nextstrain estimates that approximately 24 mutations occur in this long genome, if one viral lineage is passed along from person to person for a whole year.

* In the 30'000-nucleotides-long genome, this means approximately 1 mutation per 1000 nucleotide per year.

* This is in line with a recently published estimate: 0.4-0.7 mutations per nucleotides per year[3]

* Other coronaviruses like SARS[4] and MERS[5] mutate in a comparable pace, accumulating approximately 1 mutation/1000 nucleotides/year, while influenza virus changes more than twice as quickly, with an estimated rate of 2.3 mutations/1000 nucleotide/year[6].

# [SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients in Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav20?branchLabel=clade&d=tree&f_country=Austria&m=div&p=full)

* Since the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome, the putative root of the tree has been published in January 2020[7], many new mutations have been identified.

* On this phylogenetic tree, the horizontal axis shows the total number of mutations each sampled genome accumulated compared to the root of the tree. Only Austrian samples are shown.

* We can see that most of the genomes isolated in Austria contain less than 10 mutations compared to the root of the tree.

* The samples can be found on many different branches of the tree, meaning that the epidemic in Austria was shaped by many different introduction events of the virus to the country.

* You can also see that some samples are closely related to each other, suggesting local transmission of the virus in Austria.


# [Community transmission within Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav20?branchLabel=clade&c=location&d=tree&label=clade:Vienna1&m=div&p=full)

* Let us show you one example of local transmission of the virus!

* All samples of this branch are originated from patients in Austria.

* Most of these patients had the exact same viral lineage (all samples on the vertical line on the left)

* Others, like CeMM0187, had a further mutated version.


# [Community transmission within Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav20?branchLabel=clade&c=location&d=map&label=clade:Vienna1&m=div&p=full)

* The first sequence of this cluster was isolated from a patient who has travelled to Italy before being diagnosed in Vienna.

* Another patient travelled from Vienna to Burgenland.

* This is a unique case of an infection cluster where the origin of the virus can be deducted with certain confidence, and the further transmission is geographically limited.

* Although this viral lineage was able to spread locally in Vienna, the last representative of the branch was isolated at the beginning of April. This suggests that lockdown measures in the capital effectively stopped the spread of the lineage.
