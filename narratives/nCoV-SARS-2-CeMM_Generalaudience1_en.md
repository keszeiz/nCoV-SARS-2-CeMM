abstract: "The project [Mutational Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria](https://cemm.at/research/sars-cov-2-at/about/) was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.

SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing COVID-19, the new disease that was first described in December 2019[3]. The aim of this project is to sequence 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in Austria. So far, viral genomes have been isolated from 237 COVID-19 patients in Austria, sequenced and integrated into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Laboratories from all around the world have contributed to this map by submitting data derived from local patients. This collaborative effort will help us learn more about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the route of this pathogen from country to country.

# [Who are we and what do we do?](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?d=map&r=region&c=region)

CeMM’s mission is to achieve maximum scientific innovation in molecular medicine and improve healthcare. At CeMM, an international and creative team of scientists and medical doctors pursues free-minded basic life science research in a large and vibrant environment of outstanding medical tradition and practice.\
\
CeMM operates in a unique mode of super cooperation, connecting biology with medicine, experiments with computation, discovery with translation, and science with society and the arts. The goal of CeMM is to pioneer the science that nurtures the precise, personalized, predictive and preventive medicine of the future.\
\
Since there are so many <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/ " target="_ blank">uncertainties</a> around COVID-19, we aim at helping the scientific community to gain a better understanding of the evolution and the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19.

# [Phylogenetic analysis reveals an early branching event in SARS-CoV-2 evolution](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?branchLabel=none&c=gt-S_614&d=tree)

* Our preliminary analysis revealed a major branching event of the phylogenetic tree that occurred already in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (in January 2020).

* The new branch is shown in yellow on the phylogenetic tree, and is hallmarked by a mutation in the part of the genome that contains instructions to make the spike on the surface of the virion: the "S" protein, shown in red in the below image.

* The S protein is of crucial importance to the virus, as it interacts with the human protein called ACE2 in order to enter the host cell. However, it is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-strains-transmissible/611239" target="_ blank">not yet clear</a> whether this mutation has an effect on the function of the S protein or on its binding to ACE2.

* Based on its position within the region coding for the S protein, this mutation is called S D614G.

# [The S D614G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?c=gt-S_614&d=map&dmax=2020-01-29&f_region=Europe&label=clade:A2&p=full)

* Thanks to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing projects all over the world, we can trace the S D614G back to its origin and learn how the virus spreads.

* Our preliminary data suggest that the first two occurrences of the D614G mutation in the United Kingdom and Germany (on 22 and 28 January 2020) were connected to transmissions from China.

* However, there might have been other introduction events in Europe we do not know about because of the lack of available sequences.

* We estimate that introduction events of the virus bearing the S D614G mutation quickly led to outbreaks in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and The Netherlands.

* In the following weeks, viruses with the S D614G mutation appeared all over Europe and established as the dominant strains in many European countries.

* Moreover, sequence analysis suggests further transmission of this strain to North America and subsequent reintroduction events from the USA to many European countries.


# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?c=gt-S_614&f_country=Austria&d=tree)

This observation is in line with the results from our mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains from Austrian patients. Most of the samples from Austria show the same S D614G mutation shared by many other European strains.

# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?f_country=Austria&d=map&r=location)

* A reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny based on our sequencing data allowed us to identify connections with outbreaks in other countries.
* Based on this dataset, isolates from Austria show close connection with outbreaks in many countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Iceland, The Netherlands or Spain, as well as the United States and Australia.
* However, the direction of the transmission cannot be predicted with certainty, as the virus might spread undetected before transmission to another country where the viral genome is sequenced. In such case, it appears to originate from the country where sequencing occurred.


# [Focus on Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?d=tree,map&f_country=Austria&r=division)

Together with its collaborators all over Austria, CeMM will continue sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Austrian patients in order to understand how the virus spread to, within and from Austria, and to gain better insight into the mutational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.
