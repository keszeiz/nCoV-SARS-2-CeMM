abstract: "The project [Mutational Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria](https://cemm.at/research/sars-cov-2-at/about/) was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.

SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing COVID-19, the new disease that was first described in December 2019[3]. So far, viral genomes have been isolated from 318 COVID-19 patients in Austria, sequenced and integrated into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This week, we will concentrate on how often mutations appear in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and show mutations that likely emerged in Austria."

The virion consists of a long RNA genome that codes all the information required for its own manufacturing, hidden inside of an oily membrane. When copying this almost 30'000 "letters" long code, typos - mutations - are inevitably introduced.

* There is a chance that a mutation occurs every time the 30'000 nucleotides long RNA genome is copied. As the mutated genome can be further spread in the population, mutations will accumulate over time during a pandemic.

* Similarly to how our DNA genome and that of our parents and siblings are alike, virus genomes that largely contain the same mutations are more closely related than those containing many distinct ones.
Every time a new mutation spreads in the population, we know that these mutated genomes are close relatives.

* The example shows viral genomes isolated in Africa. Remember, whenever we see a new branch emerging from a vertical line, it means a mutation have occurred. Hoover your mouse over the branch to see which nucleotide of the 30'000-nucleotide long code has mutated.

* We see that the genomes "Uganda/UG002/2020" and "Uganda/UG001/2020" only differ in one mutation, and are closer relatives than "Uganda/UG017/2020" or "Nigeria/OS075-CV12/2020". We can now speculate that the mutation (C16293T) that created the branch where "Uganda/UG002/2020" and "Uganda/UG001/2020" belongs, have emerged in Uganda.

* However, we might also be wrong. It is possible that this mutation has emerged in another country, where it was never sequenced, but introduced to Uganda multiple times.


# [Mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other viruses](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/OnlyAustrianv19?c=clade_membership&l=clock)

* If we look at the sequences of many viral genomes and see how mutations accumulate over time, we can estimate how quickly mutations occur.

* Based on the 8000 genomes present in this dataset, Nextstrain estimates that approximately 31 mutations occur in this long genome, if one viral lineage is passed along from person to person for a whole year.

* In the 30'000 nucleotides long genome, this means approximately 1 mutation per 1000 nucleotide per year.

* This is in line with a recently published estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation (0.4 - 0.7 mutations per nucleotides per year[3])


# [The S D614G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?c=gt-S_614&d=map&dmax=2020-01-29&f_region=Europe&label=clade:A2&p=full)

* Thanks to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing projects all over the world, we can trace the S D614G back to its origin and learn how the virus spreads.

* Our preliminary data suggest that the first two occurrences of the D614G mutation in the United Kingdom and Germany (on 22 and 28 January 2020) were connected to transmissions from China.

* However, there might have been other introduction events in Europe we do not know about because of the lack of available sequences.


# [The S D614G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?animate=2019-12-19,2020-04-24,0,0,15000&c=gt-S_614&d=map&f_region=Europe)

* We estimate that introduction events of the virus bearing the S D614G mutation quickly led to outbreaks in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and The Netherlands.

* In the following weeks, viruses with the S D614G mutation appeared all over Europe and established as the dominant strains in many European countries.

* Moreover, sequence analysis suggests further transmission of this strain to North America and subsequent reintroduction events from the USA to many European countries.


# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?c=gt-S_614&f_country=Austria&d=tree)

This observation is in line with the results from our mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains from Austrian patients. Most of the samples from Austria show the same S D614G mutation shared by many other European strains.

# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?f_country=Austria&d=map&r=location)

* A reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny based on our sequencing data allowed us to identify connections with outbreaks in other countries.
* Based on this dataset, isolates from Austria show close connection with outbreaks in many countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Iceland, The Netherlands or Spain, as well as the United States and Australia.
* However, the direction of the transmission cannot be predicted with certainty, as the virus might spread undetected before transmission to another country where the viral genome is sequenced. In such case, it appears to originate from the country where sequencing occurred.


# [Focus on Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?d=tree,map&f_country=Austria&r=division)

Together with its collaborators all over Austria, CeMM will continue sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Austrian patients in order to understand how the virus spread to, within and from Austria, and to gain better insight into the mutational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

* Based on its position within the region coding for the S protein, this mutation is called S D614G.
