abstract: "SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing COVID-19.

Under the project [Mutational Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria](https://cemm.at/research/sars-cov-2-at/about/), CeMM, in collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna have so far sequenced 318 viral genomes isolated from COVID-10 patients in Austria. The genomic data has been integrated into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations.


This week, we will concentrate on how often mutations appear in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and show mutations that likely emerged in Austria."

The virion consists of a long RNA genome that codes all the information required for its own manufacturing, hidden inside of an oily membrane. When copying this almost 30'000 "letters" long code, typos - mutations - are inevitably introduced.

# [Mutations can help us draw a phylogenetic tree](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav19?branchLabel=clade&d=tree&f_region=Africa&label=clade:B4&m=div&p=full)

* There is a chance that a mutation occurs every time the 30'000 nucleotides long RNA genome is copied. As the mutated genome can be further spread in the population, mutations will accumulate over time during a pandemic.

* Similarly to how our DNA genome and that of our parents and siblings are alike, virus genomes that largely contain the same mutations are more closely related than those containing many distinct ones.
Every time a new mutation spreads in the population, we know that these mutated genomes are close relatives.

* The example shows viral genomes isolated in Africa. Remember, whenever we see a new branch emerging from a vertical line, it means a mutation have occurred. Hoover your mouse over the branch to see which nucleotide of the 30'000-nucleotide long code has mutated.

* We see that the genomes UG002" and UG001 from Uganda only differ in one mutation. They are closer relatives than UG017 or OS075-CV12 isolated in Nigeria. We can now speculate that the mutation (C16293T) that gave rise to the branch where UG002 and UG001 belongs, have emerged in Uganda.

* However, we might also be wrong. It is possible that this mutation has emerged in another country, where it was never sequenced, but introduced to Uganda multiple times.


# [Mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other viruses](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/OnlyAustrianv19?c=clade_membership&d=tree,entropy&l=clock&p=full)

* If we look at the sequences of many viral genomes and see how mutations accumulate over time, we can estimate how quickly mutations occur.

* Based on the 8000 genomes present in this dataset, Nextstrain estimates that approximately 31 mutations occur in this long genome, if one viral lineage is passed along from person to person for a whole year.

* In the 30'000 nucleotides long genome, this means approximately 1 mutation per 1000 nucleotide per year.

* This is in line with a recently published estimate: 0.4 - 0.7 mutations per nucleotides per year[3]

* Other coronaviruses like SARS[4] and MERS[5] mutate in a comparable pace, accumulating approximately 1 mutation/1000 nucleotides/year, while influenza virus changes more than twice as quickly, with an estimated rate of 2.3 mutations/1000 nucleotide/year[6].

# [Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/SARS-CoV-2-project/NextstrainAustriav19?c=location&d=tree&f_country=Australia,Austria&m=div&p=full)

* Ever since the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome was published in January 2020[7], many new mutations have been identified.

* On this phylogenetic tree, the x axis shows the total number of mutations each sampled genome accumulated compared to the root of the tree.

* While most of the genomes isolated in Austria contains less than 10 mutations more than the root of the tree, at the bottom of the graph there is one isolate from Australia that accumulated mutations in 36 different nucleotide positions!


# [Infection clusters in Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?animate=2019-12-19,2020-04-24,0,0,15000&c=gt-S_614&d=map&f_region=Europe)

* We estimate that introduction events of the virus bearing the S D614G mutation quickly led to outbreaks in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and The Netherlands.

* In the following weeks, viruses with the S D614G mutation appeared all over Europe and established as the dominant strains in many European countries.

* Moreover, sequence analysis suggests further transmission of this strain to North America and subsequent reintroduction events from the USA to many European countries.


# [Focus on Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/bergthalerlab/SARSCoV2/NextstrainAustria?d=tree,map&f_country=Austria&r=division)

Together with its collaborators all over Austria, CeMM will continue sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Austrian patients in order to understand how the virus spread to, within and from Austria, and to gain better insight into the mutational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

* <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-strains-transmissible/611239" target="_ blank">not yet clear</a> whether this mutation has an effect on the function of the S protein or on its binding to ACE2.

* Based on its position within the region coding for the S protein, this mutation is called S D614G.
