abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.


The aim is to sequence 1,000 viral genomes derived of samples taken from Austrian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The knowledge we gain will help us learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen. The results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the route of the pathogen from country to country."

We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists at CeMM in Vienna, Austria. CeMM is a Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.


We at CeMM are dedicated to better understand diseases such as cancer, immune disorders or COVID-19.


When there are so many [uncertainties]( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/ "Why the Coronavirus Is So Confusing") around COVID-19, our mission is to better understand the evolution and the spread of this disease.

# [What are mutations?](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov)

* The virion of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a tiny oily bubble that contains the genome of the virus – a long code containing information on how to make new viruses.
This is what viruses are good at: they reprogram our cells to make millions of copies of themselves.
* The code is stored in the form of RNA, and the sequence of four nucleotides represented by the letters _a_, _c_, _g_ and _u_ determine what kind of proteins will the host cell produce when it translates this almost 30,000 letters long code.
* New copies of the virus are just like the original: the code packed in the oily bubble. However, when the cell makes a copy of this long code, it will inevitably make typos. These typos are called **mutations**, and most of them do not change the proteins of the virus. Instead, they serve as signatures for us to follow how does the virus spread.

The virion consists of a long RNA that codes all the information required for it's own manufacturing, hidden inside of an oily membrane. This membrane is rich in protein protrusions, such as the characteristic "spikes", here shown in yellow, from which coronaviruses take their name.

# [What does sequencing the viral genome mean and why is it useful?](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov)

* If a mutated genome is packed into the oily membrane and infects a new host, this host will make copies of this mutated genome.
* It might again make some mistakes introducing other mutations, that could again further spread in the population.
* By sequencing the viral genome, we bring to light the sequence of the letters, thus unveiling mutations.
* A group of people who acquired the virus from the same source will have similar mutational signature. By sequencing the genomes of viruses isolated from infected patients, we can identify connections between different infection clusters and infer transmission lines. Moreover, it helps us understand the evolution of the virus.

This is a phylogenetic tree, that tracks how the genome of the virus accumulates mutations as time passes. Mutations are represented by coloured circles. On the right we see the viral genomes accommodating these mutations. While the early blue mutation is present in all of the genomes, more recent mutations, such as red ones are only present in a subset of genomes.
All genomes containing the yellow mutation are grouped together, as we infer a closer relationship between them.

# [Tracking SARS-CoV-2](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?d=tree,entropy&f_country=Austria)

Until today, CeMM sequenced viral genomes from 21 Austrian patients. In the following analysis, we compared these samples with 8343 viral genomes from 59 countries on all continents.


# [Phylogenetic analysis reveals an early branching event in SARS-CoV-2 evolution](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=gt-S_614&d=tree,entropy)

* The analysis of mutational signatures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed a major branch point in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny.
* Based on our sequence analysis, we conclude that this branching event occurred already in the early stages of the pandemic in January 2020. It bases on a mutation in the part of the genome that contains instructions to make the spike on the surface of the virion: the "S" protein.
* This protein is of crucial importance to us, as it interacts with the human protein called ACE2.  ACE2 is located on the membrane of the target cells and mediates viral entry into the cell. However, it is not clear whether this mutation has an effect on the function of the S protein or on its binding to ACE2.
* Based on its position within the region coding for the S protein, this mutation is called S D614G. (We might completely exclude its name!)

# [The S D614G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=gt-S_614&dmax=2020-02-24&dmin=2020-01-11&d=map&s=Germany/BavPat1/2020)

* Thanks to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing projects all over the world, we can trace the S D614G back to its origin and learn how the virus spreads.
* Our preliminary data suggest that the first two occurences of the D614G mutation in the United Kingdom and Germany on the 22nd and 28th of January were connected to transmissions from China.
* However, such statements should be taken with caution, as there might have been other introduction events to Europe we do not know about because of the lack of available sequences.


# [The S D614G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?animate=2019-12-19,2020-04-24,0,0,15000&c=gt-S_614&d=map&f_region=Europe)

* We estimate that the initial introduction events led quickly to local outbreaks in France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Iceland, Russia, Turkey and also Austria.
* In the following weeks, viruses with the S D614G mutation appeared all over Europe and established as the dominant strains in many European countries.
* Moreover, sequence analysis suggests further transmission of this strain to North America and subsequent reintroduction events from the USA to many European countries.

# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=gt-S_614&f_country=Austria&d=tree)

This observation is in line with the results from our mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains from Austrian patients. Most of the samples from Austrian patients show the same S D614G mutation shared by many other European strains.

# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?f_country=Austria&d=map&r=location)

* A reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny based on our sequencing data allowed us to infer some transmission lines that led to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Austria.
* Based on this analysis, we estimate introduction events connected to outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Spain, Iceland, France, and Italy.
* It is important to point out that the direction of these transmissions cannot be predicted with certainty, as the virus might have spread undetected before transmission to another country where its genome was sequenced. Hence it might appear to originate from the country where sequencing occurred.

# [Outlook: Focus on Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=division&f_country=Austria&d=tree,map&r=division)

Together with its collaborators all over Austria, CeMM will keep sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Austrian patients in order to understand how the virus spread to, within and from Austria and in order to provide the research community with insights into the mutational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.
