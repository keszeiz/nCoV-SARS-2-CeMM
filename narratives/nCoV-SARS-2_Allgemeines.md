abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.

SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing COVID-19, the new disease that was first described in December 2019 [3]. Our aim is to sequence 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from Austrian COVID-19 patients. The Austrian viral genome data will be integrated into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Laboratories from all around the world have contributed to this map by submitting data derived from local patients. This collaborative effort will help us learn more about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the route of this pathogen from country to country."
